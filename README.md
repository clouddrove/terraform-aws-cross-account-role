We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards stratergies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cross-account-role/releases).


### Simple Example
Here are an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
  module "cross-access-role" {
        source = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-multi-account-peering.git?ref=tags/0.12.0"
        name                   = "iam-role"
        application            = "clouddrove"
        environment            = "test"
        label_order            = ["environment", "name", "application"]
        master_account_id      = "XXXXXXXXXXX"
        policy_arn             = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"
       }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| application | Application (e.g. `cd` or `clouddrove`). | string | `` | no |
| description | Description of IAM Role. | string | `The role to grant permissions to this account to delegated IAM users in the master account.` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | string | `` | no |
| label_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | list | `<list>` | no |
| master_account_id | The ID of the master account to Read Only Access the current account. | string | - | yes |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | string | `` | no |
| policy_arn | Policy ARN to attach to the role. By default it attaches `AdministratorAccess` managed policy to grant full access to AWS services and resources in the current account. | string | - | yes |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`). | map(string) | `<map>` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| role_arn | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) specifying the role. |
| role_id | The stable and unique string identifying the role. |
| role_name | The name of the crated role. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
